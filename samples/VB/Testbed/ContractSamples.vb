Namespace Samples

    ' Contracts can be defined in multiple ways. The TWS/IB Gateway will always perform a query on the available contracts
    ' And find which one Is the best candidate
    '  - More than a single candidate will yield an ambiguity error message.
    '  - No suitable candidates will produce a "contract not found" message.
    '  How do I find my contract though?
    '  - Often the quickest way Is by looking for it in the TWS And looking at its description there (double click).
    '  - The TWS' symbol corresponds to the API's localSymbol. Keep this in mind when defining Futures or Options.
    '  - The TWS' underlying's symbol can usually be mapped to the API's symbol.
