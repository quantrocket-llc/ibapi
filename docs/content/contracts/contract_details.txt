/*! \page contract_details Requesting Contract Details

	Complete details about a contract in IB's database can be retrieved using the function @ref IBApi::EClient::reqContractDetails. This includes information about a contract's conID, symbol, local symbol, currency, etc. which is returned in a @ref IBApi::ContractDetails object. reqContractDetails takes as an argument a Contract object which may uniquely match one contract, and unlike other API functions it can also take a Contract object which matches multiple contracts in IB's database. When there are multiple matches, they will each be returned individually to the function IBApi::EWrapper::contractDetails. 
	
	<b>Note</b>: Invoking reqContractDetails with a Contract object which has currency = USD will only return US contracts, even if there are non-US instruments which have the USD currency. 
	
	Request for Bond details will be returned to  IBApi::EWrapper::bondContractDetails instead. Because of bond market data license restrictions, there are only
	a few available fields to be returned in a bond contract description, namely the minTick, exchange, and short name. 

	One particular use of the IBApi::EClient::reqContractDetails function is to request an option chain. See @ref option_chains for more details. 
	
	\section broadtape_list  BroadTape News List
	
	The example below shows an "incomplete" news @ref IBApi::Contract with no symbol or currency defined. In most cases using such a contract would result in an invalid 
	contract details error since a symbol or localSymbol is required. @ref IBApi::EClient::reqContractDetails will instead use it to obtain the whole BroadTape news chain from the TWS.

	<b>Important:</b> due to the potentially high amount of data resulting from such queries this request is subject to pacing. Although a request such as the above one will be answered immediately,
	a similar subsequent one will be kept on hold for one minute. This amount of time will increase if more such requests are performed. To prevent this, narrow down the amount of eligible contracts
	by providing an expiration date specifying at least the year (i.e. 2016) or the year and the month (i.e. 201603 for March 2016).
