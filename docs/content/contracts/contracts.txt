/*! \page contracts Contracts

	\section Overview
	An @ref IBApi::Contract object represents trading instruments such as a stocks, futures or options.

	Every time a new request that requires a contract (i.e. market data, order placing, etc.) is sent to TWS, the platform will try to match the provided contract object
	with a single candidate. If there is more than one contract matching the same description, TWS will return an error notifying you there is an ambiguity. In these cases
	the TWS needs further information to narrow down the list of contracts matching the provided description to a single element.

	The best way of finding a contract’s description is within the TWS itself. Within the TWS, you can easily check a contract’s description either by double clicking it or
	through the <b>Contract Info -> Description</b> menu, which you access by right-clicking a contract in TWS:

	The description will then appear:

	<b>Note: </b> you can see the extended contract details by choosing <b>Contract Info -> Details</b>. This option will open a web page showing all available information on the contract.

	Whenever a contract description is provided via the TWS API, the TWS will try to match the given description to a single contract. This mechanism allows for great flexibility since it gives
	the possibility to define the same contract in multiple ways.

	The simplest way to define a contract is by providing its symbol, security type, currency and exchange. The vast majority of stocks, CFDs, Indexes or FX pairs can be uniquely defined through
	these four attributes. More complex contracts such as options and futures require some extra information due to their nature. Below are several examples for different types of instruments.

	\section island_to_nasdaq ISLAND to NASDAQ API Compatibility

	Upcoming <i>ISLAND</i> to <i>NASDAQ</i> naming change will make all of the <i>ISLAND</i> exchange definitions invalid.<br>
	As a compatibility measure a new setting has been introduced in <b>TWS 10.16+</b>: <i>"Compatibility Mode: Send ISLAND for US Stocks trading on NASDAQ"</i>.<br>
	This setting will enable all of the contract definitions with <i>ISLAND</i> exchange to be still acknowledged.<br>
	It is <b>strongly recommended</b> to start implementing the <i>NASDAQ</i> exchange definition.<br>

	\section instrument_timezones TWS UI and TWS API timezone parity

	<b>TWS 10.16</b> has introduced a new behavior how both TWS and TWS API return timezones.<br>
	TWS API will return contract details, order information and other related timestamps with the same timezone as displayed in TWS UI.
