/*! \page rtd_simple_syntax Simple Syntax		Basic components of a Simple Syntax RTD formula are <b>ProgID</b>, <b>Server</b>, <b>\ref rtd_simple_syntax_ticker</b>, <b>\ref rtd_simple_syntax_topic</b> and <b>\ref rtd_simple_syntax_conn</b> (optional):		<DFN class="rtd_formula">	=RTD(<b>ProgID</b>, <b>Server</b>, <b>Ticker</b>, <b>Topic</b>, <b>ConnectionParams</b>...)	</DFN>		where		 - <b>ProgID</b> = "Tws.TwsRtdServerCtrl"	 - <b>Server</b> = \"\" (empty string)		\section rtd_simple_syntax_ticker Ticker		Besides <b>ProgID</b> and <b>Server</b>, the first string should represent the <b>Ticker</b> in Simple Syntax. 		To define a contract <b>Ticker</b> properly, you would need to find the correct contract attributes first. The easiest way to find contract attributes is to directly look at the \ref contracts "Contract Description" page in TWS.		The syntax for <b>Ticker</b> should strictly follow the below squence:		<b>Forex Contract:</b>			"CURRENCY1.CURRENCY2/CASH"		e.g. EUR.USD Forex can be defined as "EUR.USD/CASH"		<b>Other Contract Types: </b>		"SYMBOL@EXCHANGE/PRIMEXCH/SECTYPE/EXPIRATION/RIGHT/STRIKE/CURRENCY"		e.g. The E-mini futures can be defined as "ES@GLOBEX//FUT/201712///USD"		<i>	<b>Notes: </b>		1. Not all contract attributes are required to be specified. You can leave the field to be blank to make that field un-specified. 	Sequencially, if you only need to specify several contract attributes at the begining part of the <b>Ticker</b> string, you can leave out the rest of the string entriely as well. For example, instead of specifying "SPY@SMART//////", "SPY@SMART" would be sufficient to define the contract properly.		2. There are several default contract attributes in the Ticker string. If you leave them un-specified, they will take the default values as following:	 - <b>EXCHANGE = </b>"SMART"	 - <b>SECTYPE = </b>"STK"	 - <b>CURRENCY = </b>"USD"	 	For example, <b>Ticker</b> = "SPY" is the same as "SPY@SMART//STK////USD".		See more \ref rtd_examples "Syntax examples".	</i>		\section rtd_simple_syntax_topic Topic		The second (or other strings) can be <b>Topic</b>. <b>Topic</b> string defines the tick type you would like to receive in the formula cell. 	<b>Topic</b> can be specified within the <b>Ticker</b> string, or as a separate string.		For exmaple, the two formulas below both request the Bid Size for SPY from ARCA exchange, where the first formula includes <b>Topic</b> in <b>Ticker</b> and the second formula specifies <b>Topic</b> as a separate string:		<DFN class="rtd_formula">	=RTD("Tws.TwsRtdServerCtrl",,"SPY@ARCA BidSize")	</DFN>		<DFN class="rtd_formula">	=RTD("Tws.TwsRtdServerCtrl",,"SPY@ARCA", "BidSize")	</DFN>		If no <b>Topic</b> string is defined, the <b>Topic</b> will be defaulted to <i>"Last"</i>.		For example, the below formula will request the last price for SPY from ARCA exchange:		<DFN class="rtd_formula">	=RTD("Tws.TwsRtdServerCtrl",,"SPY@ARCA")	</DFN>		\subsection rtd_simple_syntax_basic_ticks Basic Tick Types		The table below shows a full list of available basic tick types that can be specified for the <b>Topic</b>:		<table>	<tr><th>Tick Name</th><th>Topic String</th><th>Description</th></tr>	<tr><td>Bid Size</td><td>"BidSize"</td><td>Number of contracts (or lots) offered at the bid price.</td></tr>	<tr><td>Bid Price</td><td>"Bid"</td><td>Highest bid price for the contract.</td></tr>	<tr><td>Ask Price</td><td>"Ask"</td><td>Lowest offer price for the contract.</td></tr>	<tr><td>Ask Size</td><td>"AskSize"</td><td>Number of contracts (or lots) offered at the ask price.</td></tr>	<tr><td>Last Price</td><td>"Last"</td><td>Last price at which the contract traded.</td></tr>	<tr><td>Last Size</td><td>"LastSize"</td><td>Number of contracts or lots traded at the last price.</td></tr>	<tr><td>High</td><td>"High"</td><td>High price for the day.</td></tr>	<tr><td>Low</td><td>"Low"</td><td>Low price for the day.</td></tr>	<tr><td>Volume</td><td>"Volume"</td><td>Trading volume for the day for the selected contract (Volume for US Stocks are quoted in lots.

The <b>Host IP Address</b>, <b>Socket Port</b> and <b>Client ID</b> are required parameters for initiating a socket connection.		 - The <b>Host IP Address</b> is the IP address where your TWS is running on. For a local connection, local IP 127.0.0.1 can be used. 	 - The <b>Socket Port</b> is the port for socket connection. You can setup the host port in \ref enable_api "TWS API Settings", and you need to have your API connect to the same port as you setup in TWS.	 - The <b>Client ID</b> is an identification for each API connection. TWS can maintain up to 32 API Clients connecting at the same time, and the Client ID is used to distinguish each connection. 	 This was originally designed so that API users can have multiple API programs (i.e. clients) running at the same using different strategies to trade separately. Since the TWS RTD Server API is only provided for relaying real-time data, there is no need to use multiple client IDs. 		The above three parameters are defaulted to the following values if not directly specified by the user:		 - <b>Host</b> = "127.0.0.1" (i.e. the "localhost")	 - <b>Port</b> = "7496"	 - <b>ClientID</b> = Integer.MaxValue - 1		Simple Syntax supports several pre-defined <b>Connection Parameters</b> that can be specified as a separate string (i.e. String2, String3...) in the RTD formula:		 - <i>"paper"</i>: use port=7497 for connection instead (7497 is the default port for paper TWS essions)	 - <i>"gw"</i>: use port=4001 for connection instead (4001 is the default port for live IB Gateway sessions)	 - <i>"gwpaper"</i>: use port=4002 for connection instead (4002 is the default port for paper IB Gateway sessions)	 	For example, to request High price for SPY\@SMART while connecting to a TWS logged with a paper account via port 7497:		<DFN class="rtd_formula">	=RTD("Tws.TwsRtdServerCtrl",,"SPY@ARCA", "High", "paper") 	</DFN>		\section rtd_simple_additional Additional Info		See also:	 - \ref rtd_complex_syntax	 - \ref rtd_mixed_syntax			<br><br>	*/
