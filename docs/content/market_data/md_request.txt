/*! \page md_request Requesting Watchlist Data

	Streaming market data values corresponding to data shown in TWS watchlists is available via the @ref IBApi::EClient::reqMktData. This data is not tick-by-tick but consists of aggregate snapshots taken several times per second. A set of 'default' tick types are returned by default from a call to @ref IBApi::EClient::reqMktData, and additional tick types are available by specifying the corresponding generic tick type in the market data request. Including the generic tick types many, but not all, types of data are available that can be displayed in TWS watchlists by adding additional columns. Each market data request uses a unique identifier (ticker ID) which identifies the returned data:

	\section genticks Generic Tick Types
	The most common tick types are delivered automatically after a successful market data request. There are however other tick types available by explicit request: the generic tick types. 
	When invoking @ref IBApi::EClient::reqMktData, specific generic ticks can be requested via the <b>genericTickList</b> parameter of the function:
	
	<ul id="tab">
		<li class="active"> 
			\snippet Program.cs reqmktdata_genticks

	\section md_snapshot Streaming Data Snapshots

	With an exchange market data subscription, such as Network A (NYSE), Network B(ARCA), or Network C(NASDAQ) for US stocks, it is possible to request a snapshot of the current state of the market once instead of requesting a stream of updates continuously as market values change. By invoking the IBApi::EClient::reqMktData function 
	passing in <b>true</b> for the snapshot parameter, the client application will receive the currently available market data once before a @ref IBApi::EWrapper::tickSnapshotEnd
	event is sent 11 seconds later. Snapshot requests can only be made for the default tick types; no generic ticks can be specified. It is important to note that a snapshot request will only return available data over the 11 second span; in some cases values may not be returned for all tick types.

	\section regulatory_snapshot Regulatory Snapshots

	The fifth argument to reqMktData specifies a regulatory snapshot request to US stocks and options. Regulatory snapshots require TWS/IBG <b>v963</b> and API <b>973.02</b> or higher and specific market data subscriptions. 

	For stocks, there are individual exchange-specific market data subscriptions necessary to receive streaming quotes. For instance, for NYSE stocks this subscription is known as "Network A", for ARCA/AMEX stocks it is called "Network B" and for NASDAQ stocks it is "Network C". Each subscription is added a la carte and has a separate market data fee. 
	
	Alternatively, there is also a "US Securities Snapshot Bundle" subscription which does not provide streaming data but which allows for real time calculated snapshots of US market NBBO prices. By setting the 5th parameter in the function IBApi::EClient::reqMktData to <b>True</b>, a regulatory snapshot request can be made from the API. The returned value is a  calculation of the current market state based on data from all available exchanges. 
	
	<b>Important: Each regulatory snapshot made will incur a fee of 0.01 USD to the account. This applies to both live <i>and</i> paper accounts.</b>. If the monthly fee for regulatory snapshots reaches the price of a particular 'Network' subscription, the user will automatically be subscribed to that Network subscription for continuous streaming quotes and charged the associated fee for that month. At the end of the month the subscription will be terminated. Each listing exchange will be capped independently and will not be combined across listing exchanges.

	The following table lists the cost and maximum allocation for regulatory snapshot quotes:
	
	<table>
	<tr><th>Listed Network Feed</th><th>Price per reqSnapshot request</th><th>Pro or non-Pro</th><th>Max reqSnapshot request</th></tr>
	<tr><td><CENTER>NYSE (Network A/CTA)</td><td>0.01 USD</td><td>Pro</td><td>4500</td></tr>
	<tr><td>NYSE (Network A/CTA)</td><td>0.01 USD</td><td>Non-Pro</td><td>150</td></tr>
	<tr><td>AMEX (Network B/CTA)</td><td>0.01 USD</td><td>Pro</td><td>2300</td></tr>
	<tr><td>AMEX (Network B/CTA)</td><td>0.01 USD</td><td>Non-Pro</td><td>150</td></tr>
	<tr><td>NASDAQ (Network C/UTP)</td><td>0.01 USD</td><td>Pro</td><td>2300</td></tr>
	<tr><td>NASDAQ (Network C/UTP)</td><td>0.01 USD</td><td>Non-Pro</td><td>150</CENTER></td></tr>
	</table>

	Requesting regulatory snapshots is subject to pacing limitations:

	- No more than one request per second.
